<p style="line-height: 150%; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Set 12</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: -36pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">12.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The correlation coefficients in Table 1 provide information about the linear relationship between pairs of variables. A correlation coefficient of zero indicates that there is no linear relationship between the two variables. The closer the coefficient of correlation is to -1 or +1 the stronger the relationship is between the two variables; a correlation coefficient of +1 indicates perfect positive relationship and -1 indicates a perfect negative relationship. The correlation of 0.686 between Age and Experience, for example, indicates that the higher the age of a participant the greater is their work experience on average. However, note that this relationship is not perfect, i.e., a higher age does not mean proportionally greater experience in all cases but just that on average experience is greater for the higher age group.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: -36pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">12.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "t-test" in the various regressions indicates the statistical significance of the relationship between the two variables. For example, the t-test between Salary and Age is 2.128, the absolute value of which is greater than the critical t-value of 1.969. This means that the correlation between Age and Salary is statistically significant; we accept the hypothesis that the relationship between Age and Salary that we have observed in the sample data is not simply due to chance. Furthermore, the regression coefficient of 802.9337 for Age means that as Age increases by one year the average salary is higher by $802.9337.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Note that in regression (iii), the t-test for Sex is -0.079. In this case, the absolute value of the t-test, 0.079, is less than the critical value of 1.969. Hence, we can infer that the correlation between Sex and Salary is statistically non-significant; we accept the hypothesis that the correlation between Sex and Salary is really zero in the population of interest and we have observed something slightly different than zero in our sample simply due to chance (due to sampling fluctuations). It follows that the regression coefficient of -192.7 for Sex is not significant and we accept the hypothesis that it is really zero for the population.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Similarly, we can interpret the results of the other regressions.</span></p>
