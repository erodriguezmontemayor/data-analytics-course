<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The correlation matrix signifies the degree of association between the various pairs of variables in the data. The bigger the correlation (in absolute value), the stronger the relationship between the variables.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The most appropriate regression equation includes personal disposable income, price, capital investments and advertising. The regression coefficient of personal disposable income of 5.53 means that when personal income increases by $1,000,000, sales increase by $5,500. Similarly, the regression coefficient of price of -15.4 means that, as price increases by $1, sales decrease on average by $15,400. The other regression coefficients shown below can be interpreted in a similar way.</span></p>
